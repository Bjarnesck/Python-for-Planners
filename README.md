# Python-for-Planners
This course introduces students to **Python programming** by creating a simple **urban digital twin**. The focus is on **writing simulations** that model urban phenomena. Since students may have **no prior programming experience**, [Book 1: Python programming](Book_01_python_programming.ipynb) this material explains core concepts step-by-step, building up from basic ideas to more advanced topics such as **objects, namespaces, and callable functions**. In order to get started, we first introduce the Python programming language and its ecosystem in [Book 00, The Python Ecosystem](Book_00_The_Python_Ecosystem.md). As basic text test on simulation er will use https://allendowney.github.io/ModSimPy/chap01.html  For insperation on urban digital twinns pleas see you might look at

## The course material will be a combination of different material
**For learning Python, I will be using material from**:
- Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis: https://python-gis-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- Python Foundation for Spatial Analysis: https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-foundation.html
- Google's Python Class: https://developers.google.com/edu/python
- Learn Python 3: https://github.com/jerry-git/learn-python3

**For learning GitHUB, i have taken inspiration from:**
- GitHub Foundations: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/github-foundations/

**For learning modelling, inspiration is taken from:**
- Modeling and Simulation in Python : https://allendowney.github.io/ModSimPy/index.html
- Mesa: Agent-based modeling in Python:  https://mesa.readthedocs.io/stable/
