# Python-for-Planners
This course introduces students to **Python programming** by creating a simple **urban digital twin**. The focus is on **writing simulations** that model urban phenomena. Since students may have **no prior programming experience**, this material explains core concepts step-by-step, building up from basic ideas to more advanced topics such as **objects, namespaces, and callable functions**.
