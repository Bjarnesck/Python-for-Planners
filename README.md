# Python-for-Planners
This course introduces students to **Python programming** by creating a simple **urban digital twin**. The focus is on **writing simulations** that model urban phenomena. Since students may have **no prior programming experience**, [Book 1: Python programming](Book_01_python_programming.ipynb) this material explains core concepts step-by-step, building up from basic ideas to more advanced topics such as **objects, namespaces, and callable functions**. In order to get started, we first introduce the Python programming language and its ecosystem in Book 00, The Python Ecosystem](Book_00_The_Python_Ecosystem.md). As basic text test on simulation er will use https://allendowney.github.io/ModSimPy/chap01.html  For insperation on urban digital twinns pleas see you might look at
